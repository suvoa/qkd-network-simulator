# QKD Network Simulator

This project simulates different Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols across networked environments. The goal is to study key generation, network effects, and protocol behavior under different topologies.

## Protocols implemented
- BB84
- E91 (Entanglement-based QKD)
- TF-QKD (conceptual support in network model)

## Simulator frameworks used
Two different simulation approaches are used:

### 1. SeQUeNCe-based simulator
- Used for network-level QKD simulation
- Supports BB84 and network topologies
- File: `qkd_simulatorx.py`

### 2. QuTiP-based simulator
- Used for quantum state simulation
- Implemented E91 protocol
- Used because E91 is not available in the SeQUeNCe library
- File: `e91_qutip_simulator_patched.py`

## Features
- Simulation of QKD protocols across different network topologies
- Study of key generation rates
- Analysis of channel effects and trusted relay scenarios

## Requirements
Python 3.x

For SeQUeNCe:
